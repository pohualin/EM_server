/**
 * This package contains the Spring Data JPA repositories. These classes should be used for
 * default CRUD operations as well as simple queries. Whenever you need to do more advanced
 * dynamic sorts of things you should use spring-data specifications. Worst case scenario
 * use straight JPA criteria queries.
